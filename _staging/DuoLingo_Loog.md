# DuoLingo Music

Early stages of the course are quite slow, utilizing just 3 notes until quite a bit into section 2.
I find myself skipping units often in search of material that is just a bit more challenging.
Units are fairly short though.

Unit is typically constructed of:
* A unique song for the student to learn
* An introduction to a new note when required by further songs that may include:
   * Arranging notes onto staff from low-to-high
   * Matching letter notes to either illustrations of pressed keys or to their sheet representations on a staff.
   * Matching sounded notes to their representations on a staff
   * Given a 4-note sequence, one of which is hidden; play the sequence
* Personalized practice that includes various exercises from above
* A "practice" lesson that shows the letter notes of this unit's song arranged on a scrolling staff   
* A "preparation" lesson that shows regular sheet music of the song on a scrolling staff
* A final act for the student to perform with supplementary music to make the piece more engaging.

Since the original launch of DuoMusic, _a lot_ of licensed music has been added, with each licensed song having its own unit.
There seems to often be 1-2 licensed music units between public domain music units.
Free users can play each licensed song final act up to 3 times; Super-tier access (a subscription is not necessary when DuoLingo rewards with free Super access) is required to play these songs further.

# The Loog Piano

Nice:
* Compact
  * Easy to go from being stored in case to setup on a desk.
* Sounds decent
* Supports 2 levels of key velocity (forte and piano).
* Kind of cute aesthetic

Not so nice:
* Kind of pricey
* Sustain pedal is a separate accesory at $30

Nuetral:
* 3-octave piano
   * A necessity to be compact but if 88-keys is needed, a separate octave shifter accessory is available at $40

Quirks:
* The power switch does not turn on device until quite a bit of rotation after the tactile click
* The included USB-C cable does not maintain a consistent USB connection. I had to swap to a much higher quality cable to have a good experience.


## App Integration

The piano uses MIDI over USB to register key presses in the app. Supposedly, any MIDI over USB keyboard will work with the app.

With a solid USB connection, the experience practicing with DuoMusic is quite smooth; there is far less friction compared to tapping on the screen.
There are, however, some points of friction:
* There is no way to navigate the DuoMusic course using piano keys, thus the user still must manually reach over and tap on their device screen to dismiss ads, and proceed to the next lesson.
   * This esecially kind of sucks on iPhone where the app does not support landscape for the course path interface, but using landscape for practice; creating this really awkward interaction that requires the user to navigate either with the UI rotated 90 degrees incorrectly, or to pick up their phone, move to the next lesson, put down the phone, then proceed to practice. I quickly swapped to using an iPad.
* The app does not teach hand position, posture, and scale progression, so it is difficult to figure out on one's own what the proper and efficient ways to move the hands around the keyboard are; without seeking external materials.
   * Due to this, I often feel quite awkward when, half-way through section 2, I am required to start learning to play the A and B notes, but I am not sure how to comfortably transition into moving by hand up to these keys, and then back down to middle-C.
